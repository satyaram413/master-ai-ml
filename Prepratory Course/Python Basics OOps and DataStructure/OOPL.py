# Python creates a new instance and passes it to the first parameter of .__init__().
# This essentially removes the self parameter, so you only need to worry about
# the name and age parameters.
# Attributes created in .__init__() are called instance attributes.
# An instance attributeâ€™s value is specific to a particular instance of the class.
# All Dog objects have a name and an age, but the values for the name and age attributes will
# vary depending on the Dog instance.
#
# On the other hand, class attributes are attributes that have the same value for all class instances.
# You can define a class attribute by assigning a value to a variable name outside of .__init__().
